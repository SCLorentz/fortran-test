# fortran-test

I was testing a lot of different programming languages, like C, PY, Rust and ASM. So now is time to test Fortran

I use this repo as reference to create the devcontainer: [kohei-noda-qcrg/fortran_devcontainer_sample](https://github.com/kohei-noda-qcrg/fortran_devcontainer_sample)

`docker build -t fortran-test .devcontainer`
