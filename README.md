# FRAN

Just some tests made in fortran. This isn't a very serious project, but I will try to keep it updated.

## Warn!

FPM (fortran package manager) isn't avaliable for the ARM archtecture, if you are using a mac you will have problems executing this project localy. So on this cases, I will try to use gfortran again automaticly. And let's hope that fpm add compatibility with ARM.

## Develop by your own

### My recomendations - Docker

If you want to develop your own version of this game, you should get docker installed, so you don't have to worry about configure anything or make shure that this will work on your machine, is everythig already configured for you. Besides, in a virtualized environment, errors like "it works on my machine" can be avoidable. I made this to be really simple to just "enter and use" with no need for configuration. <!--fuck the history that was deleted because of him, how could he do that with me?-->
